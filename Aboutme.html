        <p>"If you have a dream, no matter how crazy it seems, just go for it. If not now, then when? #YOLO"</p>
        <p>Being a very ambitious and determined person, Zing believes in working hard to chase our dreams as life is short. She wants to impact the world through what she does and leave behind a legacy in this world.</p>
        <p>As a very passionate musician, Zing has written and produced a total of 6 songs. She was very honoured to be able to collaborate with healthcare workers from the Healthcare Services Employees Union (HSEU) to film a music video for one of her songs, titled 'Best Wishes', which she wrote during the pandemic to show support to all of our frontline heroes who work tirelessly to keep us safe. Not only was she the songwriter and producer, she was also the editor of the video. Right now, she continues to upload song covers on her Music Channel, and she is on the process of writing an album.
        She also manages a YouTube Channel where she share insights about her life experiences and help others to become a better version of themselves. She strongly believes in making the world a better place.</p>
